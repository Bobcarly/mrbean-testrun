<p>David wakes up every day and carrys on with his daily activities,first he prays to the creator of the universe for giving him another new opportunity for having a new day,proceed later on his morning affirmations dutties and routine and from there he take up his web developement course which usually last for an hour+</p>
<br>
<p>Giving up on your dreams becuuse you not want to force yourself out of your confort zone can be one of the greatest mistakes one can make because as time goes by,you discover all what he universe needs from you is just to show u no matter how much little effort you put to be a better vession of yourself,i learned that the best way to be succesfull is to focus on the litle things around you when everyone seems to be crazy doing hesame thingh </p>
